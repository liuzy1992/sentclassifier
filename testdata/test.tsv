15917248	4	Forced expression of KLF6 strongly inhibits Dlk1 expression in preadipocytes and NIH 3T3 cells in vivo, whereas down-regulation of KLF6 in 3T3-L1 cells by small interfering RNA prevents adipogenesis.	Y
16107706	5	Deletion of KSR1 prevents adipogenesis in vitro, which can be rescued by introduction of low levels of KSR1.	Y
16467308	10	Taken together, these data support the notion that the intracellular concentrations of calcitriol can play an important role in either promoting or inhibiting adipogenesis via the VDR and the transcriptional pathways that it targets.	Y

16477437	6	One proband with early-onset obesity was found to be heterozygous for a C256Y mutation, which abrogated the ability of WNT10B to activate canonical WNT signalling and block adipogenesis and was not found in 600 control alleles.	Y
16763196	10	The involvement of Dkk1 in human but not murine adipogenesis indicates that inter-species differences exist in the molecular control of this process.	Y
17259372	2	While activation of Wnt signaling blocks adipogenesis, inhibition of endogenous Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by Wnt10b promotes spontaneous preadipocyte differentiation.	Y
17347480	8	RNA interference knockdown of TRPV1 in 3T3-L1-preadipocytes attenuated capsaicin-induced calcium influx, and adipogenesis in stimulated 3T3-L1-preadipocytes was no longer prevented.	Y
25979969	0	A cell-based screening for TAZ activators identifies ethacridine, a widely used antiseptic and abortifacient, as a compound that promotes dephosphorylation of TAZ and inhibits adipogenesis in C3H10T1/2 cells.	N

28376564	11	Thus disruption of normal tissue stroma homeostasis, as occurs in chronic inflammatory diseases, might drive "abnormal" adipogenesis which adversely influences the behavior of MSC and contributes to pathogenic recruitment of leukocytes.	N
28469599	14	In primary cell culture, TSHR activation substantially enhanced adipogenesis with 1.4 ± 0.07 (ORO), 8.6 ± 1.8 (foci), and 5.5 ± 1.6 (LPL) fold increases compared with controls.	N
